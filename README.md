WildF is a Fortran library for evaluating mathematical [Special Functions]. Just like wild creatures, Special Functions are unusual, but interesting mathematical objects that arise in many areas of applied mathematics. This library aims to serve as a support for any project that needs the computation of these rare species.

## Functions
In the following list, $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and $z \in \mathbb{C}$.

* Exponential integrals \(Ei(x)\) and \(E1(z)\).

This list will be updated as new functions are added and tested.
